### ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
In this project, we designed a **Single-Cycle RISC-V Processor** with a **Direct-Mapped Cache** and successfully implemented the design on an FPGA device.

---

### ðŸ”§ Key Features
- Our Single-Cycle CPU design supports 35 out of the 47 instructions specified under the *RISC-V RV32I Base Integer Instruction Set*.
- Coverage includes:
  - Basic Computational Instructions (all except *LUI*)
  - Control Transfer Instructions
  - Load and Store Instructions
- Supports all four core RISC instruction formats (*R, I, S, U*) and their two variants (*UJ, SB*).
